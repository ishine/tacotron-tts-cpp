# Text-to-speech in (partially) C++ using Tacotron model + Tensorflow

Running Tacotron model in TensorFlow C++ API.

Good for running TTS in mobile or embedded device.

Code is based on keithito's tacotron implementation: https://github.com/keithito/tacotron 

## Status

Experimental.

Currently only running Tacontron model is coded in C++.

Python preprocessing is required to generate sequence data from text.
Python postprocessing is required to do `inv_preemphasis` for Tacotron generated .wav.

## Requirment

* TensorFlow r1.8+
* Ubuntu 16.04
* C++ compiler + cmake

## Compiling Tensorflow 1.13 

COmpilation of this projects requires compiling tensorflow from source as it uses some headers files that are generated 
during compilation of tensorflow ( bazel compilation)

*  Install  Bazel 0.21 ( Not version above that)

```
wget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/0.21.0/bazel-0.21.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh
bash bazel-0.21.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh
```

*  Install Tensorflow

```
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
cd tensorflow
git checkout r1.13
./configure ( i used CPU version)
bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
bazel build //tensorflow:libtensorflow_cc.so
bazel build //tensorflow:libtensorflow.so

```

*  ABSL library

```
cd /usr/local/inclue
git clone https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp.git
mv abseil-cpp/absl .
```

## Dump graph.

In keithito's tacotron repo, append `tf.train.write_graph` to `Synthesizer::load` to save TensorFlow graph.


```
class Synthesizer:
  def load(self, checkpoint_path, model_name='tacotron'):

    ...

    # write graph
    tf.train.write_graph(self.session.graph.as_graph_def(), "models/", "graph.pb")
```

## Freeze graph

Freeze graph for example:

```
freeze_graph \
        --input_graph=models/graph.pb \
        --input_checkpoint=./tacotron-20180906/model.ckpt \
        --output_graph=models/tacotron_frozen.pb \
        --output_node_names=model/griffinlim/Squeeze
```

Example freeze graph file is included in this repo.

## Build

Edit tensorflow path(Assume you build TensorFlow from source code) in `bootstrap.sh`, then

```
e.g  TF_DIR =/usr/local/tensorflow-1.13.1
     TF_EXTERNAL_DIR = /usr/local/tensorflow-1.13.1/bazel-tensorflow-1.13.1
     TF_BUILD_DIR = /usr/local/tensorflow-1.13.1/bazel-bin/tensorflow
```

```
$ export CC=clang
$ export CXX=clang++
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ build
$ make
```
Note :Use Clang for Compilation of Project as with GCC i was getting  "ASAN:DEADLYSIGNAL" error .

## Run

Prepare sequence JSON file.
Sequence can be generated by using `text_to_sequence()` function in keithito's tacotron repo.

```
convert_to_sequence.py ( uses https://github.com/keithito/tacotron/tree/master/text)

from text import cleaners, symbols, text_to_sequence, sequence_to_text
from unidecode import unidecode

a = text_to_sequence('scientist at cern laboratories says they have discovered a new particle',['english_cleaners'])
print(a)


[46, 30, 36, 32, 41, 47, 36, 46, 47, 64, 28, 47, 64, 30, 32, 45, 41, 64, 39, 28, 29, 42, 45, 28, 47, 42, 45, 36, 32, 46, 64, 46, 28, 52, 46, 64, 47, 35, 32, 52, 64, 35, 28, 49, 32, 64, 31, 36, 46, 30, 42, 49, 32, 45, 32, 31, 64, 28, 64, 41, 32, 50, 64, 43, 28, 45, 47, 36, 30, 39, 32, 1]


make file sequence01.json as below

{ "sequence" : 
 [46 , 30 .....]
}
```

See `sample/sequence01.json` for generated example.

Then,

```
$ ./tts -i ../sample/sequence01.json -g ../tacotron_frozen.pb 
(generates output.wav)
```

We need to further process generated `output.wav`.
In keithito's tacotron repo, run python script like this

```
import io
import numpy as np
from librosa import effects
from util import audio

wav = audio.load_wav("output.wav")
wav = audio.inv_preemphasis(wav)
wav = wav[:audio.find_endpoint(wav)]
out = io.BytesIO()
audio.save_wav(wav, "processed.wav")
```

example output01.wav and processed01.wav is included in `sample/`

## Performance

Currently TensorFlow C++ code path only uses single CPU core, so its slow.
Time for synthesis is roughly 10x slower on 2018's CPU than synthesized audio length(e.g. 60 secs for 6 secs audio).

## TODO

* Write all TTS pipeline fully in C++
  * [ ] Text to sequence
  * [ ] inv_preemphasis
